Welcome to the end of the world, or what's left of it.[w]
I'm the last of the wanderers.[w]
This place used to be a city, a bustling metropolis filled with life and dreams.[w]
Now, it's just a graveyard of memories. The air is thick with dust, and the silence is deafening.[w]
But even in this desolation, there's a spark of hope.[w]
You see, hope is a stubborn thing. It clings to the darkest corners of our hearts, refusing to let go.[w]
And maybe, just maybe, that's enough to keep us going.[w]
So, here we are, standing at the edge of oblivion. But as long as we keep walking, keep searching, there's a chance.[w]
A chance to rebuild, to reclaim what was lost. And maybe, one day, this wasteland will bloom again.[w]
Welcome to the wasteland. This is just the beginning.[stop][c]
