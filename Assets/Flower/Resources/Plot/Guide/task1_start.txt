Now, traveler. I got a job for you.[w]
A bunch of Dustwarriors have been causing trouble around here.[w]
They've been raiding us, taking whatever they can get their hands on.[w]
These scumbags have no respect for anyone, least of all us wanderers trying to scrape by.[w]
I need you to teach them a lesson. Go out there and take down at least three of those Dustwarriors.[w]
Show them that we won't stand for their thievery.[w]
They've been stealing the tech and supplies we've been gathering.[w]
Don't let them get away with it. Once you've dealt with them, come back here.[w]
I'll make it worth your while.[stop][c]
